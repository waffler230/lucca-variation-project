        <h1>Some say</h1> <h2>the world will</h2> <h3>end in fire,</h3>
        <p>Some say in ice.</p>
        <u>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of</u> <h4>desire</h4>
        I hold with those who favor fire.
        But if it had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate
        To say that for destruction ice
        Is also great
        And would suffice.
