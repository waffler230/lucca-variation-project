        Some say the world will end in fire,
        Some say in ice.
        From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
        I hold with those who favor fire.
        But if it had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate
        To say that for destruction ice
        Is also great
        And would suffice.
