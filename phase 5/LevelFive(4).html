    <body>
        <div>Some say the world will end in <il>fire,</il>
        Some say in ice.
        From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
        I hold with those who favor <il>fire</il>.
        But if it had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate
        To say that for destruction ice
        Is also great
        And would suffice.</div>
