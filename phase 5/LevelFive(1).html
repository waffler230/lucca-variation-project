        <h1>Some say <strong>the world will end</strong> in fire,</h1><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Some say in ice.</h2>
        From what Iâ€™ve tasted of <div>des<p>ire</p></div>
        <p>I hold with those who favor fire.
        But if it had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate
        To say that for destruction ice
        Is also great
        And would suffice.</p>
