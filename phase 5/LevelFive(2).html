       <p>Some say the world will end in fire,</p>
    <p>Some say in ice.</p>
        From what Iâ€™ve tasted
         of<div> desire</div>
       <h3> I hold with those who favor fire.
        But if it had to perish twice,</h3>
        I think I know enough of <p>hate
        To say that for</p> <h5>destruction</h5><h4>ice
        Is also great</h4>
