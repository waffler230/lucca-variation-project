Some say the world 
<br><ol> <big> <big> <strong><ul><h2> will end</h2></ul></strong><br> </ol> </big> </big>
in fire,Some say in <h1>i</h1><h1>c</h1><h1>e</h1>.
<p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to<strong> perish twice</strong></p>,
I think I know enough of <H1>hate</H1>
To say that for <small>destruction</small> ice
Is also great
And would <em>suffice.</em>
