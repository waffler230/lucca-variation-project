        <p>Some say the world will end in fire,
        Some say in ice.
        <div>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
        I hold with those who favor fire.
        But if it \<il>had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate</il>
        To say that for destruction ice</div>
        <em>Is also great
        And would suffice</em>.<p>
