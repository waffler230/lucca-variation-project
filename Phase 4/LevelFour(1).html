        <h1>Some say the world will end in fire,</h1> <br><br>
        <H2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ay <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ice.</H2>
        <U>From what Iâ€™ve</U> tasted of <h3>desire</h3>
        <p>I hold with those who favor fire.
        But if it had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate
        To say that for destruction ice
        Is also great
        And would suffice.</p>
