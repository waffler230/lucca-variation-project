        <p>Some say the world will end in</p> <h1>fire,</h1><br><br><br><br><br>
        <u>Some say in</u> <h2>ice.</h2>
        <p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</p>
        <p> I hold with those who favor <h1>fire.</h1>
        But if it had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate</p>
        <u>To say that for destruction</u> <h2>ice</h2>
    <p>Is also great
        And would suffice.</p>
