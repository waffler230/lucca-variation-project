       <p> Some say the world will end in<strong><il>fire</il></strong>,
        Some say in <strong><u>ice</u></strong>.
        From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
        I hold with those who favor <il>fire</il>.
        But if it had to perish twice,
        I think I know enough of hate
        To say that for destruction <u>ice</u>
        Is also great
        And would suffice.</p>
