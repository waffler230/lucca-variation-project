Some say the world will end in <h1>fire</h1>,
Some say in <big><h2>ice</h2></big>.
<p>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of <strong>desire</strong>
I hold with those who favor <h1>fire</h1>.
But if it had to perish <br>twice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I think I know enough of hate
To say that for <big><strong>destruction</strong></big> <big><h2>ice</h2></big>
Is also great
And would suffice.</p>
