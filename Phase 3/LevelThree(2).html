<big>Some say</big> the world will end in fire,<br>
<big>Some say</big> in ice.<br>
<ul>From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</ul>
<ul>I hold with those who favor fire.</ul>
<ul>But if it had to perish twice,</ul>
<big><small>I</small> think <small>I</small> know enough of<strong> hate</strong></big>
To say that for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BIG>destruction</BIG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ice
Is also <big><li>great</li></big>
And would suffice.
